## KPI'S REQUIREMENT
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

### Total Revenue:
The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
### Average Order Value: 
The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
### Total Pizzas Sold: 
The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
### Average Pizzas Per Order:
The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## CHARTS REQUIREMENT

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

### Daily Trend for Total Orders:
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

### Hourly Trend for Total Orders:
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart aims to illustrate the popularity of various pizza categories and their contributions to overall sales.

### Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:
Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.

### Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:
Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

### Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:
Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.

### Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:
Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.
